Steps to reproduce the problem : If you open any redmi note 7 with stock miui rom and set the region to canada,usa,uk or india and many more you will be able
                                 to use low band 5G wifi . And its channel range is 36-48. I myself have a router that contains that range. But after flashing 
                                 pixel experience I am unable to use the 5G low band wifi. But I asked many of the users in telegram they told me they were 
                                 able to use the 5G wifi but they had high band 5G wifi . And its channel range is 148-165 . So I think  there is somesort of 
                                 bug going on. One day I just added my 5G network name manually just by going into wifi and used add network after that I 
                                 restarted the mobile 5-6 times. And I was able to connect to the network for 8-10 minute and it went away. So I think there is 
                                 working place for it.
